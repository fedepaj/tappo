## Sensor and actuators
* Sensors:
    * ultrasonic range finder sr04: to determine the distance between the water and the neck of the tank.

    * switch: detects when the cap is placed/removed. The one chosen is [this](http://smparts.com/product_info.php?cPath=2_602&products_id=6689) and it is placed in the circuit like [this](https://killerrobotics.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/lever-switch_bb.png).

* Actuators:
    * piezo buzzer: makes a pretty annoying sound;

    * led: is surely a visual cue but could really be switched by a NO relay.

## Misc
* Case: holds the sensors together and makes it a perfect lid for a 43mm 30L plastic tank that will be filled with 15mm tubing.
* Shield: gives order to the messy cables
